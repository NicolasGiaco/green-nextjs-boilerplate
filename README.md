# 🌱 Green Next.js Boilerplate

A Next.js boilerplate optimized to minimize environmental impact with maximum performance and reduced carbon footprint.

## 🎯 Goals

This project aims to create a starting point for Next.js applications by prioritizing:

- **Energy performance**: Optimized code to reduce CPU/memory consumption
- **Minimal data transfer**: Reduced bundle size and network optimizations
- **Green hosting**: Ready-to-use configuration for eco-responsible hosts
- **Ecological monitoring**: Tools to measure environmental impact

## ✨ Eco-friendly Features

### 🚀 Technical Optimizations

- **Smart bundle splitting** with impact analysis
- **Advanced compression** (Brotli, Gzip)
- **Optimized images** with next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF)
- **Aggressive lazy loading** of components
- **Service Worker** for optimal caching
- **Selective preloading** of critical resources

### 📊 Environmental Monitoring

- Built-in carbon impact dashboard
- Energy consumption metrics
- Automatic optimization reports
- Eco-responsible Core Web Vitals tracking

### 🌍 Green Configuration

- Environment variables for green hosts
- Optimized deployment scripts
- Eco-responsible CDN configuration
- Smart caching strategies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for robust code
- **Tailwind CSS** with aggressive purging
- **Custom Bundle Analyzer**
- **ESLint/Prettier** with eco-responsible rules
- **Lighthouse CI** for continuous auditing

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/green-nextjs-boilerplate.git
